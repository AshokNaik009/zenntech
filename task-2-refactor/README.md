# Task 2: Refactored CSV Import Endpoint

## Problems Identified in Original Code

1. **Performance Issues**: Sequential database inserts using `await` in a loop is extremely inefficient for large datasets
2. **No Error Handling**: No try-catch blocks, validation, or error responses to the client
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: No file type validation, size limits, or input sanitization
4. **Data Integrity**: No validation of CSV data before database insertion
5. **Memory Issues**: Loading entire file buffer without streaming for large files
6. **No Logging**: No observability or debugging capabilities
7. **Poor User Experience**: Generic success message with no details about import results

## Improvements Implemented

### Performance
- **Batch Processing**: Using `insertMany()` instead of individual `create()` calls
- **Streaming**: Processing CSV with streams to handle large files efficiently
- **Memory Management**: Proper buffer handling and cleanup

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks with specific error messages
- Validation errors reported with row numbers and details
- Graceful handling of partial failures

### Security
- File type validation (CSV only)
- File size limits (10MB)
- Input sanitization using Joi validation
- Proper error responses without exposing internal details

### Data Validation
- Schema validation for each property record
- Required field validation
- Data type validation (positive numbers for price)
- Detailed validation error reporting

### Observability
- Structured logging with Winston
- Performance metrics (processing time)
- Error tracking with stack traces
- Import statistics and summaries

## Installation and Usage

```bash
cd task-2-refactor
npm install
npm start
```

## API Usage

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/import-properties \
  -F "properties-csv=@sample.csv" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
```
